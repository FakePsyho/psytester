[0.5.1]
* run: --debug mode added
* show: new general/leaderboard replaces general/show_XXX options and allows for custom leaderboard order
* show: new options for including/excluding specific results files, use --files LIST OF FILES / --xfiles LIST OF FILES respectively; you can use both at the same time
* show: you can use --dir to specify the directory for the files
[0.5.0]
* complete overhaul of cmd line help
	* --help will only show the explanation for arguments relevant to your mode (e.g. run, show, find)
	* help descriptions should be more clear now
	* some of the commands are invoked differently, most notable run is now "mmtester r ..." instead of "mmtester ..."

* show: new option --var VARIABLE in order to show stats for VARIABLE instead of score
* show: --noscale override to remove scaling from cmd line

* show: additional "Missing" column for tests missing score (or a specified variable)
* find: you can use --tests as a filter 
* run: removed --benchmark as it was a cumbersome option and was inferior to just running "mmtester show" during the run
